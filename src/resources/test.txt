This is a test file. This file will be used to test my program. I am not sure how I am going to write this program because
it is very difficult and I am out of coding practice. It's main point is that there's different characters that may need to be counted but I don't
want to include periods or commmas or other extraneous characters but I do want to count apostrophes that are part of words.
